These are the pakages we will need to make the intended histogram:


```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

Making a histogram;
First we extracted the data we wanted to appear on our graph

```{r}
query<-"SELECT weight
FROM Master"

result<-sqldf(query)

```

From there its similar to making a scatterplot, just approiate alterations where necessary, i.e. introduction of "bin" function 

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(data=result,aes(x=weight),color="yellow",fill="white",bins=50)+
                   ggtitle("Body Weight Distribution for Baseball Players")
```
