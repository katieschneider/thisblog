These are the pakages we will need to make the intended time series plot;


```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

Now, say we wanted to see progessive change over time- we would contruct a time series graph. In this case we wanted to see Babe Ruths number of homeruns over the years;
Note- time is always on the x axis and the changing varaible will be on the y axis
Extracting the data;

```{r}
query<-"SELECT yearID,HR
FROM Batting
WHERE playerID='ruthba01'"

result<-sqldf(query)
```

Now, let's visualize this;

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  ggtitle("Ruth's Homerun Total Through the Years")+
  xlab("year")+
  ylab("homeruns")
```
