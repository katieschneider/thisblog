<th align="right">In his article “Russia’s Interests in the Syrian Conflict: Power, Prestige, and Profit’, Azuolas Bagdonas examines and explains Russia’s unwavering political support to Bashar Assad’s regime. The article is written on the perception that Russia continues support due to their foreign policy doctrine of multipolarity and Russian desire to maintain influence in the region, despite material interests in Syria.</th>

<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">Bagdonas begins by thoroughly explaining the evolutionary steps that led to the current humanitarian crisis and civil war in Syria, stating that no response has been able to force the Syrian regime to change its approach or its leadership to step down. Further saying that this is at the fault of Russia’s, backed by China’s, response. Russia has willfully resisted most international attempts to “hike up” international pressure on the regime, blocking at least three security council resolutions. This response has shielded Assad’s regime from facing full international consequences and has contributed to the extension of the conflict.</td>

<h2>Russia’s position and view has essentially remained the same since the start of the civil war in March 2011. The Russian mindset has been shaped by strategic considerations, including the fate of the geopolitical landscape if Syria were to fall and Russian opposition to the practice of humanitarian intervention abroad. Russia continuously called for suspension of force on all sides and a peaceful resolution of the crisis through a “broad-based national dialogue”, stressing the absence of outside interference. Russia deemed the opposition to Assad’s regime as “terrorists” and hoped on the capabilities of Assad and his administration to deal with the crisis by appeasing the protestors with political reforms. As this ideology became more and more unrealistic to the point of impossible, Russia began encouraging splits among opposition groups and buying the regime “stalling time” by resisting and blocking developments in the UN therefore delegitimizing efforts to build pressure on the regime. Today Russia is willing to sacrifice the removal of Assad to save his regime by conceding a transitional government made up of the present government and the opposition. Their step towards resolution still greatly favors the government but recognizes reality.</h2>

<h2>If Syria were to fall, Russia would lose a major naval facility stationed in Syria, company investments, lucrative arms sales, and a large trade relation. Beyond the tangible losses, the fall would hinder Russian long-term strategy in reestablishing itself as a global actor and a great power by losing a great deal of influence in the Middle East. With these assets in mind and the overarching disinterest in involvement within outside interstate issues, Russia has intentionally backed Bashar Assad.</h2>

<h2>The second article analyzing the Syrian conflict was “Armed Conflict in Syria: Overview and U.S. Response” by Middle Eastern Affairs specialist Christopher Blanchard, analyst Carla Humud, and specialist Mary Nikitin. This article provided the players involved, an overview of the issue, and mainly the United States response to the issue. Of Syria’s population, 22 million, four million have fled into neighboring countries while 7.5 million are internally displaced and in dire need of humanitarian assistance. The constant fighting in Syria shows no imminent end as government forces are fighting a multitude of insurgencies while quickly losing presence and control of large areas of the country, resulting in a multi-sided bloody catastrophe. All sides are evolving quickly growing in numbers and strength as most global actors become involved based on personal goals and preferred outcomes, examples include Russian support of Assad and U.S. support of select opposition groups. Derived from Christopher Blanchard’s article the United States has allocated nearly $400 million for nonlethal assistance to select opposition groups. While also funding $4 billion to provide 7.5 million displaced Syrians in need of humanitarian assistance.</h2>

<h2>Thus far the United States has clearly defined its position in the Syrian crisis but has engaged and acted on its ideology with caution. Initially the Obama administration called for Assad and his regime to step down but as the complexity of the situation and unlikelihood of this solution became more apparent U.S. policy was reshaped. The United States has denounced the regime’s leader but mainly focuses its aid to combatting the powerful insurgency and terrorist group within the civil war, ISIS. The U.S. has actively provided nonlethal support to those fighting ISIS in Syria while continuing to promote and engage in multilateral efforts to reach a negotiated settlement between the Syrian government and opposition forces. As U.S. defense officials have identified Assad’s presence as “an aggravating factor and a contributor to the appeal of extremist groups”, the U.S. believes a peaceful solution is only possible through the willful, or managed, removal of Assad from office. But the U.S. has not provided support in combatant with the government as it predicts that the total collapse of the whole regime could further conflict, war, and ethnic cleansing. Therefore, drawn from the lesser of a multitude of evils, a political transition would grant a much-preferred outcome.</h2>

<h2>Gathered from the two articles it seems there is some correlation between Russian and United States response. While supporting different sides, both see the potentially disastrous outcome of the total fall of the current regime and both push for political reform. This is blocked by both sides approaches to the issue both encouraging different outcomes of a transitional government and future political reform. Both sides acknowledge the unlikelihood of an imminent halt to violence or reached solution.</h2>
